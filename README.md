# taskmanager

A simple task manager project has being done using React.js,HTML,CSS,Javascript,React-Bootstrap and react Router for navigation. I have used Context API for state Management. And used Firebase Realtime Database for storing the data and also fetched the data to show on the screen for the users. I have deployed this project using Netlify.
